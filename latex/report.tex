\section{Camera radiometric calibration}
\label{sec:crc}

In this section, we describe how we take pictures and estimate the relationship between $B$ and $T$.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Taking pictures}

In order to simulate a surface with uniform radiance, we put a scratch paper on the table. Then, we took 9 pictures with a Canon 5D Mark II(DSLR) and a 40mm lens. A tripod was utilized to stabilize the camera. ISO was set to 100. F-number of the lens was set to 4. The exposure times of those 9 pictures are $1/25s$, $1/30s$, $1/40s$, $1/50s$, $1/60s$, $1/80s$, $1/100s$, $1/125s$, and $1/160s$ respectively. Pictures are all JPEG format. Figure \ref{fig:samplepicture} shows a picture taken with $T = 1/30s$ as an example. \\

Sample area was chosen to be the center of the picture with a size $100\times 100$. As shown in figure \ref{fig:sampler}, \ref{fig:sampleg} and \ref{fig:sampleb}, the sampled areas are not saturated in any channels. And the strips confirmed that the pictures were taken very stably.

\subsection{Discovering the relation between $B$ and $T$}

$B$ is estimated by the average value of the sampled area $B'$. We calculate $B'$ in RGB channels independently in order to solve the non-linear function between $B'$ and $B$. \\

We assume $B(T) = (B'(T))^g = cETG = KT  $ following the assumption given by the instruction where $K = cEG$. By applying logarithm to both sides of the equation, we have 
$$ g\ln(B') = \ln(K) + \ln(T) $$
$$ \ln(B') = \ln(K)/g + \ln(T)/g = a + b\ln(T) $$ where $a = \ln(K)/g$ and $b=1/g$. \\

We used sklearn to estimate the coefficient of linear regression by taking $[\ln(T_i)]$ as the $X$ vector, and $[\ln(B'_i)]$ as the $Y$ vector. As shown in Table \ref{tab:linear}, the result suggests us to choose $g_R = 2.308$, $g_G = 1.962$ and $g_B = 1.484$ for RGB channels respectively. We show the $B'^g(T)$ curves before and after applied estimated $g$ in Figure \ref{fig:samplecurves}\\


\begin{table}[]
\caption{Linear regression results}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Channel &  $a$  &  $b$ & $g$ & mean squared error  \\
\hline

Red & 7.011 & 0.4334 & 2.308 & 0.004156 \\
\hline
Green & 7.129& 0.5097 & 1.962 & 0.002331\\
\hline
Blue & 7.297 & 0.6737 & 1.484 & 0.0008915\\
\hline

 \hline

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:linear}
\end{table}


With estimation of $g$, and given the value of $B'(T) = (KT)^{1/g}$ for some pixel, we can estimate $B'(T_{dest})$ by 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
B'(T_{dest})     &=  (KT_{dest})^{1/g}\\
            &=  (KT)^{1/g}T_{dest}^{1/g}/T^{1/g}\\
            &=  B'(T) (\frac{T_{dest}}{T})^{1/g}
\end{aligned}
\label{equ:nonlinear}
\end{equation}
for the same pixel. Also, we can estimate $B(T)$ by
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
B(T)     &=  B'^g(T)
\end{aligned}.
\label{equ:linear}
\end{equation}

\section{Acquire a picture stack}
\label{sec:stack}

We took another 10 pictures with the same camera and a 17mm lens. ISO was set to 400 and F-number was set to 4. The optimal exposure time was chosen to be $T_0 = 1/100s$ so that there were no saturation(ensured by the warning from camera). Then we picked another two pictures with $T_1 = 1/4s$, $T_2 = 6s$, since they got good exposures on different layers as shown in Figure \ref{fig:picturestack}. \\

Equation \ref{equ:linear} was applied to obtain the linearized pictures. To ensure the values of $B(T)$ fall in the range $[0,255]$, we divided the values of $B(T) = B'^g(T)$ by $255^{g-1}$ for each channel. The result is also shown in Figure \ref{fig:picturestack}.
