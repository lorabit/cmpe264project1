# Part 1

Before you run p1.py, you may need to edit this file to adjust some parameters as follow:

1. sample_rect: a array of 4 elements indicating the position(x,y) and size(height,width) of simpling area. In our case, we set it to (1300,1300,100,100).
2. channel: a int specifying which channel we are dealing with. 0 for Blue, 1 for Green and 2 for Red.

Then, you can get linear regression and its plot by running p1.py.
